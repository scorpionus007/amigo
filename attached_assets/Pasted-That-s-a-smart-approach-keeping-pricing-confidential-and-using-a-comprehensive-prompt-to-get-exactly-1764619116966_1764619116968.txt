That's a smart approach—keeping pricing confidential and using a comprehensive prompt to get exactly what you need from a modern development environment like Replit.

Here is the complete, detailed prompt, designed to be dropped directly into an AI code generator (like Replit's Ghostwriter or similar tools) to build your single-page HTML/CSS/JS website.

## 💻 Replit Code Generation Prompt: AMIGO Single-Page Website

**Objective:** Build a modern, highly focused, single-page website for a tech services agency named AMIGO, reflecting its core brand identity, services, and target audience. The output must be a single project containing `index.html`, `style.css`, and a minimal `script.js`.

### 1. Business & Brand Identity

| Element | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Agency Name** | **AMIGO** |
| **Full Meaning** | MIGO stands for "Make It Go Online" |
| **Tagline** | Your Partner in Digital Transformation. |
| **Domain** | makeitgo.online (Do not display the domain on the hero/main title text.) |
| **Core Tone** | Professional, Trustworthy, Approachable, Strategic, and Focused on **Action/Growth**. |

### 2. Visual & Design Requirements

The design must be clean, modern, and high-contrast, utilizing the defined brand colors.

| Element | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Color** | **AMIGO Blue:** `#1E90FF` (Used for primary buttons, main icons, and key highlights.) |
| **Accent Color** | **Progress Green:** `#3CB371` (Used for secondary CTAs, checkmarks, and process step highlights, symbolizing growth/action.) |
| **Typography** | **Headlines:** Montserrat (Bold and authoritative). **Body Text:** Lato or Open Sans (Highly readable). |
| **Logo Integration** | The logo (Icon + AMIGO text) should be placed in the sticky header. The provided logo visual concept (blue circle with a green/white right-pointing arrow) should be represented using appropriate Font Awesome icons or simple CSS shapes within the HTML structure. |
| **Design Style** | Clean, minimalist, and responsive (mobile-friendly). Use ample whitespace. |
| **Pricing** | **STRICTLY DO NOT INCLUDE ANY PRICING OR RATE INFORMATION.** |

### 3. Target Audience

The content and tone must directly appeal to these two segments:

1.  **Startups:** Looking to **quickly ship** their Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and validate the market with high-quality, scalable code.
2.  **Mid-Scale Businesses:** Seeking to **scale their existing tech infrastructure**, modernize legacy systems, or implement robust internal/enterprise software (like CRMs).

### 4. Services Offered

The website must clearly present these four service categories:

* **Web & Product Development** (For public-facing products/sites)
* **Custom Application Development** (For bespoke web applications and core software)
* **Enterprise Solutions & CRM** (For business systems, data management, and BI)
* **Internal Software Dev** (For workflow automation, legacy system modernization)

### 5. Website Sections and Content

The site must be a single-page structure (`index.html`) linking to the following anchor IDs:

| Section ID | Focus & Content Requirements |
| :--- | :--- |
| `#Home` | **Hero Section.** Headline: "Launch Faster. Scale Smarter." Subtext must clearly link AMIGO to its MIGO meaning and target audience. Include a prominent **Call-to-Action (CTA)** button. |
| `#Services` | **Services Offered.** Use the four categories listed above. Present them in an icon-based grid format. |
| `#Portfolio` | **Proof of Concept.** Feature the following client examples to establish credibility, formatted as success highlights (not full case studies): **White Carbon Motors Website**, **WCM Squad (Application Partner)**, **Enarv Books (File Management System)**. |
| `#Process` | **Our Approach.** Outline the 5-step process (Strategy, Architecture, Development, Deployment, Support). Use green-colored numbered markers or icons for each step. |
| `#Contact` | **Lead Generation.** A simple form with fields for Name, Email, Project Type (Dropdown: MVP, Scaling, CRM, Other), and Project Details. The submit button should be a secondary CTA color (Green). |
| `Header/Footer` | Sticky Header with navigation links and Logo. Footer with copyright and basic links (Privacy/Terms). |

### Deliverables:

Generate the code for the following files:
1.  **`index.html`:** Full HTML structure including content and linked CSS/JS.
2.  **`style.css`:** All necessary CSS to implement the design, layout, responsiveness, and color palette.
3.  **`script.js`:** Minimal JavaScript for smooth scrolling (if necessary) or a simple form validation placeholder (Do not include any complex backend logic).
